Issue: In MyWork v25.9.0, users are unable to alter the content of a comment as intended because the cursor position of the TextField is reset after each change.

We are assigning a new value after replacing the bullet Unicode characters

Is there a workaround that we can suggest?
If not can the release /fix be expedited?



+Summary+ - Users are unable to alter content of a comment as intended because the cursor position of the TextField is reset after each change

+Impact+ -  This issue is creating a poor user experience, COOP UK has rejected the 25.9 app due to this comment issue, and is asking for a hotfix. 

Co-op Group are only permitted to release mobile updates every 3-months due to their IT governance.  They have tested 25.9 and found an bug that will prevent them from moving this version to Prod. If they miss the window they will not be able to update the MyWork App until February.

In Legionella and Delivery temperatures checks all stores are not able to put - figure in the temperature field, instead it is putting a . (dot) which is falsifying the information and checks as temperatures need to be within a certain range.

The issue has started since the production upgrade and is happening on mobile devices (tablet, PDA), back office is fine.

There is no way to correct any incorrectly added/submitted forms. 

Please can this be looked into urgently as this is affecting all the stores. 

Also, I have a recording that a store sent which I am not able to attach to the ticket. Only PDF, JPG and JPEG are allowed to be attached?

I will send it to Shruti in an email for reference.

Bug,TM-58906,Loop PP: Skip-based attributes are not working,Done,Neha Shukla,2025-Oct-06 5:46 PM,"
	
	
		This is a ticket for a Partner IMPL**
Hello,
I am trying to build a walk using the skip based attributes. Please find attached two screenshots related to the set up of the two skips I am testing this with. 
The objective is that when executing this walk, the stores that do not have the attributes Car_wash OR Fountain_unit with a value of 'Yes' should not have visibility of either of the two groups of questions. 
	
	



Example of store that do not have the Car_Wash attribute with Yes value:
STR106
Example of store that do not have the Fountain_Units attribute with Yes value but DO have the Car_Wash attribute with Yes value:
STR105
STR115

1. Log in as SYSADMIN / LOOP$y$@dm!n2274  https://looppp.reflexisinc.com/kernel/views/authenticate/W/LOOP.view
2. Go to Walk templates, find walk template ""Attribute based skips demo 4""
3. Go to Skips
4. See the set up of the two skips that skip one group of questions each depending of the attribute ID with value Yes. See screenshots attached.
5. Switch unit to STR106 and use Team Leader-Store as profile/dpt
6. Go to Store Walk execution
7. Find walk ""Attribute based skips demo 4""
8: Expected result: That the ""Carwash"" group of questions should not appear when executing this walk as STR106 does not have the Car_Wash attribute mapped. 
9. Actual result: The ""Carwash"" group of questions does appear when executing this walk
10. Same happens when trying to test the other skip rule related to the Fountain_Units attribute. Switch unit to STR105 and Team Leader profile
12. Go to Store Walk execution
13. Find walk ""Attribute based skips demo 4""
14. Expected result: The ""Fountain Unit"" group of question should not appear when executing this walk as STR105 does not have the Fountain_Units attribute mapped. 
15. Actual result: The ""Fountain Unit"" group of questions does appear when executing this walk

I've also tried to set the skips to be when ""False"" but then none of these two groups appear when applying that set up.

We have deleted the logs and reduced the mount disk usage to below the threshold level. Please continue to monitor this alert, as the job is still running and the middleware will continue to clear files. If the alert reoccurs, please contact the applicable on-call person.

 

The space is being rapidly occupied because the log level is set to debug. We need a script to update the log level and restart the WFM JVMs.

 

@RFX-Middleware.Deployments, please use the following command to clear the files:

Bug,TM-58521,RFX - James Hall and Co Ltd - TM - G&E Harington Road Buffering Issue between 8-9am | 23544002,Done,Harsha Sutaone,2025-Sep-18 12:10 AM,"Hi,

Since Friday our G&E Harington Road store have reported issues with mobile devices in store that are not operational between 8-9am. The devices are buffering on all tasks, particularly bad between 8-8:30am. As an example it has nearly taken 3 minutes to upload a photo. After this time service resumes as normal. We have since had two other stores report the issue, Bluebell Way and Lowther Street. We have had similar issues to this in the past with system delays during certain periods, this was due to other customers launching a high number of tasks at that time. Please can this be investigated.

Bug,TM-58519,Security of Unsanitized HTML in Zebra Rendering Engine,Done,Unassigned,2025-Sep-17 10:09 PM,"Our current process reads the text/html body of the email and escapes the HTML using Python's xml.sax.saxutils library before sending it to Zebra. However, to maintain the original email formatting, we are not performing any further sanitization to strip out potentially active or malicious content.

While we've found that the content renders correctly on Zebra UI, as part of our security architecture we would like to understand how your platform handles raw HTML? 

We expect to encounter emails containing various elements, and we need to assess the risk of passing them through unmodified. Our specific concerns include:

Scripts and Active Content: (, , )

Event Handlers: (onclick, onerror, onload)

Dangerous URL schemes: (javascript:, data

Tracking Pixels and external images: ()

Forms and inputs: (, )


Could you please clarify whether Zebra employs a specific HTML sanitizer, or if your renderer is designed with a ""safe-by-default"" approach that only processes a limited subset of HTML/CSS tags and simply ignores unsupported (and potentially harmful) content like scripts?

Using these policies, kernel blocks the request if any malicious data is present in the request parameter. So if any such content is added in notes, the user will see an error while saving the notes and the notes will not be added to the project.

Bug,TM-58286,CLONE - [Major Incident] RFX - Travelodge Hotels Limited - URGENT - unable to edit walk template | 23380581,Done,Raaga Vardhini,2025-Sep-10 6:25 PM,"As per usual practice, we need to add a hotel to the distribution list on a walk template as we have had a new hotel added to our estate. We have done this multiple times in the past. 

When trying to update this today, it is throwing an error from the questions tab; although we don't want/need a description on each question group, this is a required field and it does not let us publish the walk template without one. 

Our walk template, that we've been editing and using for the last two years or so, does not have a description, and never has. This has not thrown the error before. 

Also - in trying to get these room checks out to the hotel (critical function), the system does not even allow us to add a description. There is nothing we can do with this template to add any new hotels. 

This means the hotel (and any new hotels we open in the next few weeks) will not be able to make any hotel rooms clean on the system, meaning they will not be available to the customer. 

Ideally we need the question group description removed from a mandatory requirement. We never use it as it clutters our screens and the users get what they need to know from the group title. 

Video attached show my adding the required hotel, shows the system error and me trying to edit the question group. When I click on the field, it does not do anything, I'm guessing as it does not give me the option to edit it / fix the error! 

Please can you look at this urgently. The hotel is waiting for an answer in what they can do. Our central management will also need to be informed of this critical issue and they will need regular updates on the fix. 

Do let me know if you need any more info - I look forward to hearing from you. 

Many thanks

Bug,TM-58245,"v45HNMROW: Cognos, problems with namespace USER_ACTIONS and/or AUTHORIZATION",Done,Unassigned,2025-Sep-09 6:51 PM,"In this case we have three different problem when retrieving data from these namespaces.

Description case 1:
The user 083941 has in the system access to two different stores, but when trying to list that in a report we can not get the information about store no2. I have made a report where I use the namespace USER_ACTIONS, but I have also tried the namespace AUTHORIZATION with the same result. That report is in the same place, so you can try that too.

Steps:

1. Login to WFM as sysadmin/cognos admin

2. Navigate to Users, and search for user '083941'

3. Observe that the this user has access to store ES0191 as an additional store.

4. Now open Cognos in design mode and navigate to folder: Development / Development Reflexis. 

5. run the report 'Users Access Report USER_ACTIONS'. 

Actual Result: In the report you can only see one of the stores for user 083941.

Expected Result: That all the stores which the user has access to, should be visible in the report.





Description case 2:
The user 386114 does not have access to two stores according to the user page in the system, but in the report it shows two rows. Could it be some hidden columns in the database that stores effective/end date or something?

Steps:

1. Login to WFM as sysadmin/cognos admin

2. Navigate to Users, and search for user '386114'

3. Observe that the this user don't have access to any other store then PL0111.

4. Now open Cognos in design mode and navigate to folder: Development / Development Reflexis. 

5. run the report 'Users Access Report USER_ACTIONS'. 

Actual Result: In the report you can only see two rows with different stores for user 386114.

Expected Result: That only the store which the user has access to, should be visible in the report.




Description case 3 (maybe the same as case 2):
The user 389345 does only have one profile according to the user page in the system, but in the report it shows two rows. Could it be some hidden columns in the database that stores effective/end date or something?

Steps:

1. Login to WFM as sysadmin/cognos admin

2. Navigate to Users, and search for user '389345'

3. Observe that the this user only have one profile (PD_MGR).

4. Now open Cognos in design mode and navigate to folder: Development / Development Reflexis. 

5. run the report 'Users Access Report USER_ACTIONS'. 

Actual Result: In the report you can see two rows with different profiles for user 389345.

Expected Result: That only the correct profile for the user, should be visible in the report.

This issue will be addressed as part of epic TM-46700,Invalid Issue,3,"This issue is same as that of TM-53389

Following are the steps by which this issue will replicate
 * On creator profile, create a new project, fill basic details and click on next (keep this browser open)
 * Add notes to the project
 * On a new tab, login with approver profile, do a department search, find the created project from previous step and open it
 * Advance to the second page (notes / tasks) and modify the notes
 * Back to creator profile, add a task and rollout to the project.
 * Go back to the inbox, and open that Draft project again. Launch button will be shown, launch it.

With this steps there will not even be any error in logs and creator user will be able to launch a project without sending it to approver.

Bug,TM-58049,"Walk showing completed, however photos are not available in reporting",Done,Raaga Vardhini,2025-Sep-02 7:46 PM,"Store 1172 is showing complete for a project that has an external walk attached, however the submission is not showing up in backend reporting. What is interesting is you can see it within field view.",,Duplicate,,External Walk,,,,Duplicate Issue,,"Issue: Users can resubmit the External Walk Instance even after the Feed status is updated to “Complete.”

Current Functionality/Flow:

Upon submission of an External Walk, the application processes the responses and prepares ETL messages in a background thread, subsequently updating the Feed status to “Complete.” This process typically takes 5-10 seconds, depending on system load. Once the Feed status is updated to “Complete,” users are unable to conduct the External Walk Instance again, which is the intended behavior.

Problem:

Despite the intended functionality, users can resubmit the Walk Instance even if the Feed status is updated to “Complete.” This issue can be replicated under the following scenario:

Replication Steps:

Submit the External Walk Instance, which navigates the user to the Feed.
Quickly restart the External Walk Instance within 5-10 seconds.
If the user reopens the External Walk Instance and clicks “Next,” the application reverts the Walk Instance status back to “Incomplete.”",,,,"Fix:

The application would restrict users from restarting the External Walk Instance until a configurable waiting period of 2 mins (120 secs) has elapsed. A message should be displayed if the user attempts to restart before this timeframe.

Users would be able to Take Action on already submitted instance but when Users click on Next, Save and Exit or Review below error message will be displayed.

This prevents the system to send any ETL to revert the status from Active to Incomplete hence avoiding the issue.

Error Message: 
""This instance has already been submitted. Please wait a few moments for it to complete.""",Invalid Issue,11,"Issue: working fine

Bug,TM-58047,Unable to edit recurring projects,Done,Sharad Dikule,2025-Sep-02 7:08 PM,"We need to add new hotels to our recurring projects. We do this by adding them to the master project and then the launch each day until the end of the year.

However, in the past few days we've had issues doing this. One the first page, which we do not need to change, it is resetting the duration, and then throwing an error.

This means that we are unable to edit these projects. The only way round this is to close the project down and set up a brand new master to launch the next day. 

Something has changed as we have done this hundreds of times in the past. Please help urgently, it is causing major issues as the projects are going out incorrectly, break all timed skips and our 600 hotels are all raising tickets!!! 

Please let me know if you need any more information.

Bug,TM-57979,[Major Incident] RFX - Travelodge Hotels Limited - URGENT - unable to edit walk template | 23380581,Done,Unassigned,2025-Aug-30 12:05 AM,"As per usual practice, we need to add a hotel to the distribution list on a walk template as we have had a new hotel added to our estate. We have done this multiple times in the past. 

When trying to update this today, it is throwing an error from the questions tab; although we don't want/need a description on each question group, this is a required field and it does not let us publish the walk template without one. 

Our walk template, that we've been editing and using for the last two years or so, does not have a description, and never has. This has not thrown the error before. 

Also - in trying to get these room checks out to the hotel (critical function), the system does not even allow us to add a description. There is nothing we can do with this template to add any new hotels. 

This means the hotel (and any new hotels we open in the next few weeks) will not be able to make any hotel rooms clean on the system, meaning they will not be available to the customer. 

Ideally we need the question group description removed from a mandatory requirement. We never use it as it clutters our screens and the users get what they need to know from the group title. 

Video attached show my adding the required hotel, shows the system error and me trying to edit the question group. When I click on the field, it does not do anything, I'm guessing as it does not give me the option to edit it / fix the error! 

Please can you look at this urgently. The hotel is waiting for an answer in what they can do. Our central management will also need to be informed of this critical issue and they will need regular updates on the fix. 

Do let me know if you need any more info - I look forward to hearing from you.

This issue is causing auto-complete jobs to fail due to a ClassCastException.,,,,"Provided a script to correct data for those 32 projects, also provided scripts to schedule the autocomplete of the pending 4500 projects in batches of 1000 daily.

Also added a safety check to prevent a failure in single projects autocomplete from affecting a domain autocomplete job.",Config Error,19,"*Hi [~PK3866]* 

Could you clarify the following: Vishal Kulkarni mentioned the fix for this issue was ""validated as working fine in software version 25.9.1.1."" However, the customer currently has version 25.9.1.2 deployed in Production (CL12).
 * Does this mean the fix is already deployed in the customer’s Production environment?
 * If so, why is the fix version for this issue listed as 26.1.1.0?
 * Can you confirm if the fix is included in version 25.9.1.2?

Thanks,
Victor

Bug,TM-57885,User list inconsistencies,Verify,Amey Bagul,2025-Aug-26 3:36 PM,"Good afternoon,
A couple days ago I noticed when I went into the Users list, our stores weren't showing at the beginning of the list like normal.  I changed to the second page to 51-100 and noticed some of the store were now showing.  I went back to the first page showing 1-50 and the store profiles were now showing up.  Not sure what is causing this, the issue reverts back once you log off and log back on and bring up the Users list again.  I have included a video showing this.
Thank you,
Jesse Vernon",,Work Complete,,User List Screen should be tested for all filter/page navigation/sorting behavior,,,,Legacy,,System was not maintaining the page navigation and sorting,,,,Code fixed to maintain the page navigation and sorting,Code Error,4,"*Issue Description:* When browsing the Users list (Org → User), Page 1 initially shows users 1-50. After navigating to Page 2 (51-100) and then back to Page 1, the user list on Page 1 (1-50) changes unexpectedly. The list should remain consistent when navigating between pages.

*Code Review Done –* No

*Reviewed By -* Ankit Jain (AJ8037)

*Internal Impact –* The issue causes inconsistencies in user list pagination and sorting within the application, potentially affecting internal processes that rely on accurate and consistent user display. This may impact clients who require consistent and correct access to user lists for their operations.

*External Impact –* There no external impact on the other modules.

*Code changes -* During the navigation of the Users list (Org → User), the service https://knlgatepp.reflexisinc.com/kernel/views/listusers.view is invoked for initial loading. Upon changing pagination, the service https://knlgatepp.reflexisinc.com/kernel/views/client/auth/listusersbycriteria/PULSEGP.view is called.

Both services ultimately invoke the processAndGetSecurityUsersInterface method within the UserService, but they use different formData configurations. To ensure consistent user data across both services, it is necessary to correct the default formData parameters in the /kernel/views/listusers.view service call. This adjustment will align the data retrieval process, maintaining consistency in user lists during pagination transitions.

*Testing –*
*1) Initial Page Load Consistency:*

*Scenario:* Load the Users list (Org → User) and verify that Page 1 displays users 1-50.
Expected Result: Users 1-50 should consistently appear when the page is first loaded.

*2) Navigation from Page 1 to Page 2:*

*Scenario:* From the initial load of Page 1, navigate to Page 2 (51-100).
Expected Result: Users 51-100 should display correctly without altering the order or content.

*3) Navigation from Page 2 back to Page 1:*

*Scenario:* After viewing Page 2, navigate back to Page 1.
Expected Result: Users 1-50 should display the same as when initially loaded, with no changes in order or content.

*4) Repeated Navigation Between Pages:*

*Scenario:* Continuously navigate back and forth between Page 1 and Page 2 multiple times.
Expected Result: The user lists on both pages should remain consistent on every navigation, with no changes in order or content.

*4) Sorting Order Verification:*

*Scenario:* Verify the sorting order of users on Page 1 and Page 2 during initial load and after navigation.
Expected Result: The sorting order should remain consistent (e.g., alphabetically or numerically) every time a page is accessed.

*5) Logging Out and Back In:*

*Scenario:* Log out of the application after navigating between pages, then log back in and revisit the Users list.
Expected Result: Page 1 should display users 1-50 consistently upon re-login, matching the initial load.

*6) Cross-Environment Consistency:*

*Scenario:* Test the pagination and consistency across different environments (e.g., development, testing, pre-production).
Expected Result: Behavior should be consistent across all environments.

*7) Data Integrity Check:*

*Scenario:* Verify that the user data displayed is accurate and corresponds to the intended user profiles.
Expected Result: User data should be correct and consistent with the database records.

*Issue:* In MyWork v25.6.0, the walk icon sometimes disappears from the menu on the left. They have to logout, clear data, delete the app, and log back in in order for the icon to show.

*Could you let us know all the conditions under which the walk icon would disappear from the menu?*

Below are some preliminary questions and answers we received...(see logs attached)

*Questions:*

1) Is the issue now resolved for the user? Has the user been able to replicate this since our call?

2) How long was the user logged into the application for?

3) Does the user connect to the application via the store's network?

4) Did the user experience any network / connectivity issues prior to the issue occurring?

5) The client mentioned that some of the icons under the menu disappeared, which icons were they?

*Answers*

It worked for a couple days and then unfortunately went back to not working. Like I have said before, it seems to be a gamble on the day as to whether it does work. I do often now get connection 'lost' or 'found' come up throughout the day but otherwise the connection is fine. 

I log into the application when I start my shift and stay logged in until it logs me out automatically (sometimes randomly throughout the day, otherwise usually before my next shift)

I don't use the stores network as I find it doesn't work very well so instead it just uses my data.

No network issues.

The name of the monitor I am trying to add is Update Opportunity (State = Force Closed) . I have added a screenshot of the error when it appears, and a screenshot of the configuration I am trying to add. 
Can you please take a look so I am able to add this monitor? Same issue occurs when I try to add a new one under the ""ZPA Opportunity Status"" flow.

Bug,TM-57714,BP-CL26-US-PR- Violation Tasks for Walk Not Allowing Negative Integers,Done,Amit Patil,2025-Aug-20 7:21 PM,"Hello,

I am trying to create a walk that has temperature readings included, and I would like it to create violation tasks for when the temperatures recorded are either too warm or too cold. In this case, we need a task to populate for temperatures below -40 degrees F. The question I am trying to reference in the rule allows negative integers, but when I try to create the violation task with the necessary rule, it does not let me save and gives an ""invalid formula"" error.

I was wanting to know if this is an expected behavior or if there is another way to enter the rule to allow it to go through? I would think that the rules would allow negative integers if the questionnaire allowed them. I am attaching images of the question configuration, as well as the rule configuration and the error that populates. Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide.

Is that the expected behaviour that we can successfully create projects using inactive project code (The API returned a 200 with a success response) but we can't rely on having the content stored?

On Monday, 4th Aug we have had reports from a number of stores that the system was working (wouldn't load the screen/extremely slow). However, the next day morning, it started working normally. 

Since then we have had multiple stores report that the system performance is quite poor and most often none of the tasks open as the wheel just spins. 

Below is one of the messages from a store - 

For the last 4 days we have had the same issue where come 4pm onwards reflexis on the pdas and on the back office take forever to load a page and then to complete a task takes over 20 minutes where every button press results in a spinning blue circle and a long wait time 

The rest of the store internet and services are fine, this just appears to be reflexis

Come the next morning and all pdas and back office reflexis are fine, this just seems to be happening from around 4pm but is now over consecutive days




Please can this be looked into urgently? The issue didn't seem to settle down.

Can you provide feedback as soon as possible?

Bug,TM-56965,Rack Room Shoes PROD: Please move WFM permissions of respective profiles from Pre-Prod to PROD.,Done,Vaishnavi Dalu,2025-Aug-05 2:27 AM,"This ticket is just for early heads up to L2 team. So that L2 team can plan it accordingly.

Rack Room shoes will be starting their scheduling pilot on 08/18.

We will be getting the sign from the customer on 07/24 and after that CLM team will be starting PP DB copy activity on 07/28. After that we need to move WFM profile permissions from PP to PROD.

We need to copy permissions only for WFM eligible profiles as we have enabled WFM permissions only for certain profiles in PP. We are not going to update any RTM related permissions for any of the profile in PROD.

For, all store level profiles, we need to keep only scheduling side permissions in PROD and all RTA permissions should be disabled as they will be starting pilot only for scheduling. 

For above store level profiles, we can move both RWS+RTA permissions from PP to PROD for the profiles which are eligible for WFM.

We will provide you list of all eligible profiles once we have sign off from the customer on 07/25. So that accordingly you can focus on those profiles only and move WFM permissions to PROD.",,Work Complete,,Kernel admin exports,,,,Legacy,,Exports failing in ZTM env,,,,Updated the download file logic,Code Error,5,"{*}APPLINK{*}: [https://autom07pt.reflexisinc.com/kernel/views/authenticate/W/AUTOM.view]

Then we submitted SR-06605 to have the same type of notification go to the Regional Manager, however change it to email notification and send the Notification 6 days prior to due.

Plan Types affected are Standard Plan and Standard - No Proposed State.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create plan as Stager profile, send to Scheduler
2. Switch to Scheduler profile and go to PLN > Approval Inbox, forward plan to Publisher
   **If Standard Plan, take action to ""propose plan"" before forwarding to Publisher
3. Switch to Publisher profile and go to PLN > Approval Inbox, approve and launch plan... You will receive error message.. screenshot attached.

	
	
		
		
			After some time when you go back into the Approval Inbox, it will show you that the plan has been locked even though no one has taken the action to lock it.
 ****After you take the action to try and launch the plan and receive the error, it also disappears the plan from the Plan Calendar.

 Issue 1) Reports displaying in English vs Spanish -  Someone manually changed the product language and content language to English. We have now modified the language settings to use the default language from the administration, *and all reports are now displaying in Spanish.*
Issue 2) The identified  walk data not appearing. This is because the corresponding Unit (0556 )is not saved. We have temporarily saved it from the application to resolve the PROD issue.

So, effectively, both customer reported issues are resolved.

Bug,TM-56556,Last unread on desktop - Doesn't work,Done,Raaga Vardhini,2025-Jul-22 1:38 PM,"Hi, see video in attachement. I cant replicate this myself, maybe because im the creator of the chat group; but the last unread doesnt seem to work on desktop. PRD UserID = 731249",,Work Complete,,"Impact Analysis:

Code Review Done	Yes
Internal Impact – (Function Areas)	QCHAT > Groups at least 3 users.
The issue arises under specific conditions, predominantly affecting group settings. Consider a scenario involving multiple users in a group:

User A sends a message and subsequently deletes it.
User B does not view this message before deletion.
User C views the message before it is deleted.

User B experiences the issue because the deleted message does not contribute to the unread message count. However, the database retains the isRead property for this message. As a result, although User B did not read the message prior to its deletion, the unread counter does not include the deleted message, and thus the badge is not displayed. Conversely, the logic responsible for displaying the last read separator message accounts for all messages, including those that have been deleted, leading to the problem.

External Impact – (Product Names)	N/A
API Test	N/A
JUnit Test	Yes

Solution:
Code fix, to skip deleted messages from logic to add the last read separator message.",,,,Legacy,,"Issue is happening from beginning.

A store reached out today asking why they haven't received some drug test kit they ordered back on 6/27.

The form instance was submitted on 2025-06-27T19:43:24.813+00:00 and initially held a “Pending Review” status. It was subsequently approved by the reviewer, and the status was updated to “Active.”

However, a Model History record was not generated when the instance became active, and the status was not updated to “Active (15)” in RAR.

Observations:

No ETL transactional records were found in NOTIFICATION_DATA, AUDIT_ETL_LOG, or ETL_SQL_LOG collections after the instance was approved. This indicates that the application did not process any ETLs when the instance was approved, resulting in the Model History not being generated and the status not being synced with RAR.

Bug,TM-56436,Inconveniente con Filtros en Bandeja de Entrada,Done,Unassigned,2025-Jul-17 5:35 PM,"Estimados, buenos días:

Se están aplicando filtros en la bandeja de entrada según el tipo de proyecto y el departamento correspondiente.
Por ejemplo, se está filtrando por el tipo de proyecto “Acción Corporativa” y el departamento “Dinámica Comercial”.

Sin embargo, el filtro no está funcionando correctamente, ya que si bien se filtra correctamente el tipo de proyecto, se muestran resultados de otros departamentos distintos al configurado.

Adjunto imágenes como evidencia del inconveniente.

Quedo atento a sus comentarios.

Bug,TM-56435,Broadcast message function is not working in Production,Done,Pramod Duraphe,2025-Jul-17 4:35 PM,"Hi,
Overnight we had a deployment of RWS v45.1.17.0 and RTM v25.6.1.6 into our production environments. 

Broadcast messages now fail to display within production. Due to another issue within Scheduler I attempted to display a scrolling message - as shown in attached screenshots 'Broadcast message as set in PROD.png' and 'Broadcast message settings in PROD.png', however it is failing to display. I have set it to be visible for all profiles and all users.

I have tested a Broadcast Message in PreProd and that displays fine - as in screenshot 'Broadcast message working in PP.png'.

Nathan",,Closed by Salesforce,,,,,,Closed by Salesforce,Others,,,,,,,4,"Hello [~AJ8037]

Bug,TM-56406,Project Inbox filter - Duration only accepts 365 days,Done,Komal Anbhule,2025-Jul-16 7:01 PM,"Good morning,

I had a creator reaching out looking for a project that she had sent a couple years ago because she wanted to redo a similar one.  I went in to the Project Inbox and tried to go back 5 years to search for her projects and got an error saying the duration can't be more than 365 days.  This made the process very long because I ended up having to use the calendar 4 different times to find the correct year.  Why can't this allow you to search for as many days as possible when doing a custom search?  Before the change to only include the last year as default, you could go back as far as you want to search. 

Also, the calendar jumps around a lot when moving from month to month, as seen in the video I attached.

Bug,TM-56393,Tasks Cannot Be Deleted,Verify,Raaga Vardhini,2025-Jul-16 4:24 PM,"Good morning, 

I am editing various projects and need to delete specific tasks. (Each summer, we review all projects for accuracy with our corporate teams). 

There have been instances were tasks inside some of these projects need to be deleted, but I am getting an error message when I click the trash can icon on the task, or the ""Delete"" option is grayed out when a task check box is selected. The ""Saving"" blue circle just keeps spinning. 

This is the case for all projects that include the highlighted portion of the title in the screen shot. This is true for numerous projects, so I'm not sure if there's a way to update this for all projects in the system, or if you need to check each project individually.

Bug,TM-56333,Time Restriction Calculation,Done,Unassigned,2025-Jul-14 3:36 PM,"Hi Mark,

Can you help us understand how to calculate time restriction within the Walk setup correctly? For our Quarterly and Semi-Annual Walks, we have to set a time restriction in the walk to have the due date set correctly. 

We just launched new walks on 7/7/25 @ 12AMand set them with a 92 day time restriction, in order for them to be due 10/6/25 @ 11:59 PM. For some reason, they are showing a due date of 10/7/25 @ 11:59PM which is an extra day. But I'm still showing 92 days is the correct count. Same happened for our Semi-Annual where we used 184 days, should be due 1/6/26, but shows 1/7/26. How should we be calculating or do you have any idea why this is including an extra day all of the sudden. You can use the 911 Testing (Quarterly) or Alarm System Testing (Semi-Annual) Walk Templates to review (please don't make changes in Prod).",,Work Complete,,Repeating Walk Schedule Setup at Template Screen,,,,Regression,,"Issue 1: Time Restrictive Toggle Behavior

Description: When a user enables the “Time Restrictive” toggle to input a specific number of days, navigates to a different tab, and then returns to the original tab, the toggle becomes disabled.

Root Cause: The Time Restrictive Setup (Days option) was not being saved in the database, causing the toggle to revert to its original state.

Technical Issue: There was a UI issue where the Time Restrictive Setup JSON was not being returned when fetching the parameters needed to save data in the database.

Issue 2: Incorrect End Date for Time-Restricted Schedule

Description: For a schedule restricted to 92 days, with a start date of July 7 at 12:00 AM, the expected end date should be October 6 at 11:59 PM. However, the system currently displays the end date as October 7.

Explanation:

This behavior aligns with the current functionality, where the application adds the specified number of days to the current date and sets the Walk End Date to the end of the day. This approach ensures that users have at least one full day to complete the Walk Instance.",,,,"Issue 1:

Corrective Action: The solution involves ensuring that the Time Restrictive Setup JSON is returned when the “Days” option is selected, allowing it to be properly saved in the database.

 

Issue 2:

Example: If a template is submitted at 3 PM on July 30 with a Time Restrictive setup of 1 day, the application will generate a Walk Instance with a Start Date of July 30 at 12:00 AM, ending on July 31 at 11:59 PM. This configuration provides users with more than a day to complete the Walk Instance, rather than just a few hours.

 

Considerations:

*Internal Impact* – In dataload logs, time will be displayed as per the time zone provided in ""kernel.cron.default.timezone"".

*External Impact* – In cron file upload logs, time will be displayed as per the time zone provided in ""kernel.cron.default.timezone"".

 # Check the time printed in the log is as per the timezone provided in kernel.cron.default.timezone

 

Issue Details :

*Issue :*
Previously, the Start Time and Complete Time for batch jobs were displayed according to the server/system time zone. However, due to recent changes in the GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) setup, the JVM time zone has been explicitly set to UTC. As a result, the times are now displayed in UTC.

The displayed timestamps currently do not include the time zone information, which creates confusion. This ambiguity has led to the false impression that the batch jobs are being triggered at the wrong time.

For instance, in the ticket [https://jira.zebra.com/browse/TM-56324], the client has scheduled the batch job to run at 4:00 AM US time. However, due to the lack of a time zone indicator, it appears as though the jobs are being triggered at 8:00 AM, even though they are indeed running as per the intended schedule at 4:00 AM US time.
!NewLogs.png|thumbnail!

 

*Prerequisite*
Value of ""kernel.cron.default.timezone"" property should be set in each environment.

!Time zone changes.png|thumbnail!

 

*Solution:*
The Start Time and Completed Time will now be displayed based on the time zone configured in the kernel.cron.default.timezone property. This ensures that the timestamps align with the specified time zone for clarity and accuracy.

Additionally, the displayed time will explicitly include the time zone value for better understanding. For example:

Format with Time Zone:
2025-09-19 04:35:37 AM EDT
2025-09-19 04:35:37 EDT
This approach eliminates any ambiguity regarding the time zone and provides clear, user-friendly timestamps.

Identify performance characteristics and limitations of the third-party API.
Define internal handling strategies for rate limits, timeouts, retries, and fallbacks.

Specifically;

Third-party API details captured:

-Rate limits (e.g., requests per second/day/week)
-Response time SLAs or average response times
-Payload size limits
-Concurrent request handling
-API usage quotas or throttling policies

Capture any service-level expectations or guarantees (e.g., 99.9% uptime).

Bug,TM-55836,"[Major Incident] RFX - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. - myCP: Active users showing Inactive status in myCP | 22294073",Done,Priyanka Anumula,2025-Jun-26 2:01 AM,"During the past two weeks, we have received 30+ reports from non-branch users (primarily Market Admins) and also some branch employees stating that they lost access to myCP even though they are Active employees.  When viewing the impacted employees in myCP, their user status is Inactive.  Our dev team has conducted research, and there appears to be a disconnect between what is showing in the UserListExtract file, and what displays in myCP.

Examples:
Validated data for this 2 employees (W587165; R742104).
Particularly for this 2 employees myCP didn't send any termination and in userListExtract file I can see active profiles but in tool profiles showing as inactive. 
Observed similar behavior for MSAdmin profiles as well.
in latest userListExtract file (06/16) am seeing most of them as active but in tool profiles are inactive.

Please review and let us know if additional information is needed.

Bug,TM-55834,RFX - James Hall and Co Ltd - Overall Walk Report Not Showing Correct Information | 22251557,Done,Raaga Vardhini,2025-Jun-25 7:04 PM,"When viewing the overall walk report its not showing the correct information on task completion. 

For example on may 31st Blackpool completed all 3 temperature check tasks, you can see this from the store level execution report. 

But on the overall walk report this is only showing that Blackpool completed 2 of the temperature check tasks. It says they didnt do the evening check but when you view it on store level execution you can see they did complete it. 

This is happening at more than 1 store so reporting isnt correct and we cant rely on this as we have external companies coming in and completing visits",,Work Complete,,External Walk ,,,,Legacy,,"Issue: Users can resubmit the External Walk Instance even after the Feed status is updated to “Complete.”

Current Functionality/Flow:

Upon submission of an External Walk, the application processes the responses and prepares ETL messages in a background thread, subsequently updating the Feed status to “Complete.” This process typically takes 5-10 seconds, depending on system load. Once the Feed status is updated to “Complete,” users are unable to conduct the External Walk Instance again, which is the intended behavior.

Problem:

Despite the intended functionality, users can resubmit the Walk Instance even if the Feed status is updated to “Complete.” This issue can be replicated under the following scenario:

Replication Steps:

Submit the External Walk Instance, which navigates the user to the Feed.
Quickly restart the External Walk Instance within 5-10 seconds.
If the user reopens the External Walk Instance and clicks “Next,” the application reverts the Walk Instance status back to “Incomplete.”",,,,"Fix:

The application would restrict users from restarting the External Walk Instance until a configurable waiting period of 2 mins (120 secs) has elapsed. A message should be displayed if the user attempts to restart before this timeframe.

Users would be able to Take Action on already submitted instance but when Users click on Next, Save and Exit or Review below error message will be displayed.

This prevents the system to send any ETL to revert the status from Active to Incomplete hence avoiding the issue.

Error Message: 
""This instance has already been submitted. Please wait a few moments for it to complete.""",Code Error,8,"Issue: working fine

Bug,TM-55493,Repeating Walks Showing As Scheduled,Done,Hardi Dadhaniya,2025-Jun-13 9:28 PM,"Hello,

I was looking to understand why a Walk which has been set up as a repeating shows on the Store Walk landing page as a scheduled Walk?

I've attached a screen shot for reference, this is the Out of Oven Temperature which was created under site 1001 as a store colleague role. It was Saved and Exited by Craig Chelton and then when I go to view the Walk, it shows as scheduled.

Thank you for your help.",,Closed by Salesforce,,,,,,Closed by Salesforce,Others,,,,,,,2,"Hi [~HD1845] ,

CL 55 PR:

{DOMAIN_ID:122480099,MODEL_ID:""FORM_489"",TXN_CATEGORY:""C""}

Walk Template : ""Out of Oven Temperature Checks""

For Above Walk Template, Auto Un-Claim feature is enabled.

Hence when a User clicks on Save and Exit button then Walk Instance will get auto-unclaimed.

Below are some technical details when a Walk Instance gets Auto Unclaimed.

Application updates below fields in WALK_SCHEUDLE_INFO Collection for the Instance:
 * USER_ID to -1
 * CLAIM_FLAG to N
 * CLAIM_DATE  to null
 * STATUS to N

 

Now, because the STATUS has been updated to N (New), we show Walk Instance status text as Scheduled in the UI.

For the Adhoc Walk Creator, when an Instance is either Unclaimed or Auto-Unclaimed, we show status text as Scheduled ,a Continue button and Claim label.

This indicates the User that the Walk Instance is available to claim and User can continue the Walk Instance which is currently scheduled to the User Profile (As the Adhoc Walk Instance was originally started/scheduled by that User Profile).

Note: Adhoc is a frequency, Walk Instance is always scheduled either at Adhoc/Scheduled/Repeating Frequency.

 

However, for the mentioned Walk Template SYSADMIN User profile is the Walk Admin.

Hence, SYSADMIN user profile is able to view/conduct the unclaimed walk instance.

As Walk instance was not created by SYSADMIN user profile, application does not show continue button and claim flag as it was originally started by Store User Profile.

For Walk Admins, application would only show Resume button as Walk Admin has View/Conduct permissions for the instances.

 

Note: Claim Flag and Continue button is visible to Store User who has started the Adhoc Walk Instance.

This is working as per functionality and hence not an issue.

Please communicate with the Client and explain the above functionality.

Bug,TM-55394,Data Discrepancy in Walk Schedule Report (regular or v2),Done,Pramod Duraphe,2025-Jun-11 5:34 PM,"I am trying to report on our Walk Completion for the month and noticed that the reporting is inaccurate. I have tried both the regular Walk Schedule Report and the v2 (in this version, we added Completed Late column). Filter to date 5/7/25 to 6/6/25. It shows 8 Walks in the Incomplete column, but if you click on the 8, it only shows 1 record. 

Using Store 24 Crystal Lake to look further, it shows 9 Scheduled. If you click on the 9, you get the pop up for only shows 5 records (should show 9). And it says 4 in Incomplete. If you click the 4, the pop up shows no data. If I go look at the Crystal Lake Branch View, all 9 Walks launched during that timeframe are in ""Approved"" status, there are NONE in Incomplete. 

Can we please look into why this reporting is showing several Incomplete when they are not (across all Branches) and why the pop outs are not providing correct information?

Subject: RE: Cl03 links are showing down on uptime

 

Hi @Sharma, Sachin

We have created the missing indexes , we will monitor tomorrow and let you know if we observing any alerts .

Thanks.
Ajay Kappera

Hi Ajay,

 

As discussed on call, the query on KNL_ORG_UNIT was the slowest  : 



 

 

 

We found below 2 Indexes was missing on collection KNL_ORG_UNIT which can cause slowness :

 

db.KNL_ORG_UNIT.createIndex({""domainNo"":1,""unitLevel"":1},{background:true,name:'UI_KNL_ORG_UNT_ULVL'});

db.KNL_ORG_UNIT.createIndex({""domainNo"":1,""unitSkey"":1},{background:true,name:'UI_KNL_ORG_UNT_USK'});

 

Please create the above indexes and monitor for next day

 

@RFX-Middleware.Deployments – If issue occurs tomorrow, can we take a kernel JVM thread dump before we do restart of JVM ?

 

Regards,

Sachin

 

 

Hi Team,

Bug,TM-54506,Reflexis User Load Processing Delay – Error Files One Day Behind,Done,Vishal Kulkarni,2025-May-23 12:26 AM,"Hello,

We are currently facing an issue with the daily User Load process generated through Reflexis. Typically, we receive an email notification from Reflexis at around 9:30am each day with either a success or error message once the load is processed for the day.

However, since May 10, 2025, we’ve observed that the error notifications being received correspond to the previous day’s file, rather than the current day’s. Notably, no User Load was received on May 9, and ever since, the files being processed appear to be a day behind. (User load integration ran successfully on 9th May)

Ideally, Reflexis should receive and process the current day's file after Workday's User Load Integration runs, and the corresponding notification (with errors, if any) should reflect the same day’s data.
It is very important that the error file for a given day is generated and loaded on the same day, so all associates load into reflexis without any issue.

Attached are screenshots of notifications on 8th and 10th may for your reference.

Request you to please look into this issue and help resolve the misalignment in the file being processed.

Thanks,

Bug,TM-54422,Grupo Control PP: System is allowing mapping a user with a Corp profile  to a unit from field through the user load,Done,Unassigned,2025-May-20 5:31 PM,"Review the user file attached. All user records are mapped to a Unit from Zone level (ZONA12) to a Corporate profile (SUPERVISOR). When processing this file via a user data load, no error occurs and this is allowed (all records like this should actually get rejected)
For user ID TESTUSERZONE, it appears mapped to a Zone level unit, but no profile mapping occurs.  It even allows to map the SUPERVISOR profile to the GERENTE_ZONA profile (field level profile at zone level) at the same time. 

1. Login as SYSADMIN / GCTL$y$@dm!n22275 on https://gccpp.reflexisinc.com/kernel/views/authenticate/W/GCTL.view
2. Go to Data Loads, choose user
3. Load file attached
4. ALl records will get processed as Successful
5. Go to User screen, search for TESTUSERZONE
6. See that on the first screen before going into the user record, it appears as it were mapped to the SUPERVISOR profile. When clicking on the user record, this user is not actually mapped to any profile. 

Expected result is that all of these user records should've gotten rejected as it is a discrepancy when mapping a field level unit to a corporate profile. However, records were successful.

Bug,TM-54089,Force Closed Projects using Auto Complete,Done,Shandilya Gade,2025-May-15 1:21 AM,"Trying to understand why Projects being ""Completed"" using the Auto Complete feature on Projects are showing as Force Closed in Reporting.

We set the Auto Complete to 100 days for all of our Wednesday Communication  & Scoop Projects (sent out weekly). I can see that several Projects from early January were closed by the system and within the Project Inbox, you can view the Project and the status is ""Completed Late"". However, when you view the Field View Execution Metrics Report (v2), they show under Force Closed. Should these not just show as Completed Late instead (we added that column in this report for v2)?

There is a difference between Force Closed and Completed Late, correct?

Also, to note - this was NOT the behavior prior to the 12/25/24 Wed Comm Project. If you look at the Wednesday Communication 12.04.2024 Project, there were many that were closed by the system on 3/22/25 and those are not showing in the same report as Force Closed. So it seems this behavior changed sometime before 12/25/24.

Can you look into this and provide more information on expected behavior. I have looked in Knowledge Center and cannot find any detailed information on how Force Closed or Auto Complete affect reporting, etc.

Bug,TM-53677,RFX - MAXIMA LATVIJA - Cannot create projects from templates | 21790723,Done,Unassigned,2025-May-07 3:02 PM,"Issue: Cannot create projects from templates. It shows an error. The issue is applicable almost to every template (there are 2 exceptions that I saw, templates ""INFO: project type - AD preču grupu iepirkumu daļa"" and ""INFO: project type- tirdzniecības uzdevumi). A big part of office employees create projects from templates and it is slowing our work, especially with a project ""Derīguma termiņi"", from a template ""Derīguma termiņu pārbaude"".

Expectations: All templates are working and projects can be created from them.

Steps: 1. Log in to Prod; 2. Switch to DIVISION; 3. Go to Task Manager-Project Inbox; 4. Click on ""Templates""; 5. As an example find a template ""Derīguma termiņu pārbaude"" and try to click on ""Submit"". It will show an error; 6. Then try to find a template ""INFO: project type - AD preču grupu iepirkumu daļa"" and try to submit it. It will be okay. 

We must fix this issue ASAP since it is a very important feature and we need all the templates to work well.

We encountered an issue with when copying a project that the old roles are getting assigned the projects.
Replication steps-
We created 2 new roles GM and CSM,there by removing their assignment from the Deptmgr lead roles.
But when a project is copied and launched ,the system is sending these projects to GK for approval and GK has to make these changes.
The intention is that the application should not let them send to these roles since they no longer exist in the env.
Few screenshots are attached showing how the project without assignment is allowed to go to next stage with hitting next.
also project is sent for approval without assigned role.
Thanks,
Radhika",,Code Issue,,"assignee selection on following screens:

- Project creation screen (pre and post launch)
- task screen (pre and post launch)
- simple project creation screen (pre and post launch).

For single assignment project, user will be forced to select new assignment on edit. For multi assignment only the available will be marked as selected by default. If none, user will need to select new assignment(s).

We have modified the walk instance status from ""Active"" to ""Incomplete"" in Mongo and tested the ETL's. We don't have any impact on the RAR end.

After changing the status in Mongo, we are receiving the following ETLs ([^ETLMessages.txt]) to update the data in the RAR.

If the customer wants to resubmit the instance responses, we can change the instance status from ‘A’ (Active) to ‘I’ (Incomplete). However, if the customer does not submit the responses after changing the status, the responses will still be available in RAR. It is advisable to delete the data from the tables after changing the instance status in Mongo.

Run the delete script in RAR after changing the status in Mongo.

The root cause of this issue was a problem with the  root certificate trusted list. The issue happened due to a google update and we have rais ed a ticket with google.
Meanwhile, our Cloud ops team have implemented a workaround by manually updating the trusted list. 

Walk attachments Recovery:
As Nikhil explained below, the attachmnets have not been stored anywhere, due to GCS connectivity issue.  As a result, we are unable to retrieve these attachments/images. 

In related ticket - TM-53314, we have suggested a workaround where the walk status could be changed to ""I"" and then users could resubmit the walks with the attachments. 
However, in case of this customer(First National Bank), there is a problem with this approach, as these walks have violatons and the violations have already been generated and also completed.

<p>Walk attachments Recovery:<br/>
As Nikhil explained below, the attachmnets have not been stored anywhere, due to GCS connectivity issue.  As a result, we are unable to retrieve these attachments/images. </p>

<p>In related ticket - <a href=""https://jira.zebra.com/browse/TM-53314"" title=""[MAJOR INCIDENT] RFX - BCU - Unable to view submitted attachment for Walks | 21698610"" class=""issue-link"" data-issue-key=""TM-53314""><del>TM-53314</del></a>, we have suggested a workaround where the walk status could be changed to ""I"" and then users could resubmit the walks with the attachments. <br/>
However, in case of this customer(First National Bank), there is a problem with this approach, as these walks have violatons and the violations have already been generated and also completed. <br/>

Can you walk me through this inbox filter update?  We need to be able to see and search all projects.  
When I open up the filter and try to change the duration it is not working.  

We need a simple way to click to search all projects in all statuses.

Can we change the default setting on this?

Please refer to the confluence for updating the default configuration for Inbox screen - https://confluence.zebra.com/x/0g0WJw.
As per engineering recommendation, it is better to keep the value as 365 days but the default values can be changed for customer up to 3-4 years if there are not much projects created for the customers. 
There is an additional status filter applied on default landing screen which will be limiting the search. Refer to the same confluence page for updating the configuration, if required. 
*Impact:* Performance of default landing of Inbox screen may degrade with increasing the default and max duration days and including completed projects.

*Please note that the configuration should be changed only by the exception for the customers who really wants to search from old projects.*

Bug,TM-53029,RTM: Need to disable ability for user to edit form title,Done,Unassigned,2025-Apr-11 4:27 PM,"The user is able to edit the title of a form when they are submitting it.
We use forms for several types of communication, so the form title is crucial in determining what the team is sharing and in reporting (for tracking specific issues).
We need the ability for users to change the form name to be disabled for forms.
I could not locate a permission switch/button in the form itself for turning off editing the form name.  Perhaps, there is one located somewhere else in the module and we just need some direction on where to find it.  Otherwise, we need Zebra to make changes.

Both instances were generated using Repeating setup. 

The instance ""1728014426406"" was also conducted & submitted by a user. This means that that the UNIT ""STR05138"" was previously present in the distribution list.

 

The template was later edited on 2024-10-30, and 2024-11-06.
It seems like the Store was removed from the distribution during these edits, but the Walk instance for that store had already been generated.

Therefore, user is not able to conduct this walk.

This is working as Expected.

However, the compareDates utility method did not account for DST (Daylight Saving Time) and incorrectly returned that the instance had already been generated. As a result, the process skipped the instance creation.

Root Cause: The system did not use the correct offset while comparing dates.",,,,"Corrective Action: The system has been updated to use the raw offset when comparing dates to ensure instances are generated correctly.

As discussed, this is not a bug.

Database refresh being performed to only one module will result in data discrepancies with other products. Going forward, can you please plan the refresh to be done for Kernel as well so that data is kept in sync.

For resolution on current scenario:
 * RWS only client : 
 ** Perform complete Sync of Units as there can be Units with different hierarchical structure as RWS is refreshed from another database.
 * RTM & RWS Integrated client (For this scenario, there are two options that can be followed):
 ## Dataload - 
 *** Create Unit dataload file with complete Units data as per existing RWS and import the same into Kernel.
 ## Sync
 *** Unlicense RTM20 temporarily.
 *** Perform complete Sync of Units using trigger.
 **** Note that in this case, the source of truth for Unit data will be RWS as trigger will sync units by getting data from RWS. 
 *** License RTM20

*Note:*
 * Syncing the units by using trigger will clear all the existing data from Kernel and sync the complete data from RWS.
 * After syncing , ensure to perform *Publish* as updated units information has to be synced into RAR.
 ** Publish All Units Modified Notification

Please let us know in case of any queries.

Bug,TM-52587,Violations Disappear,Done,Abhay Vijay Patil,2025-Mar-28 1:18 AM,"When creating the Gap Check for Q2 in pre prod it was noted that some violations were missing when a question was selected as 'issue, Minor Issue or Major Issue'.

On checking the violations were all present in the build and had previously worked. It was found that when we deleted the violation and rebuilt it it then would flow through when 'issue, Minor Issue or Major Issue' was selected.
After running some test I believe when i change the sequence of my questions this is what has caused the violation to not flow through. 
I have never had this issue before and it is not unusual for us to realign (adjust the sequence of our questions ) during the build.  This has caused a lot of extra work in our testing as we have had to : 
1. Establish if the violations were built correctly
2. Retest multiple times
3. Try and work out the cause of the issue i.e. Human error or system based
4. Rebuild all the violations that failed (approx. 15)
5. Retest once these were rebuilt.

If this could please be reviewed as to why this is now happening that would be appreciated as it is going to add to our workload if we have to rebuild and retest a violation every time we move a question.

I will send a video through shortly.

As soon as the project is with the gatekeeper, he should be able to forward it to himself and approve and start it.
Instead, the project is sent back to the creator when it is forwarded and this should not be the case.

Login as TESTRTMVREOT use Projecttyp Tagesinfo ""TIR"" and create a Project without the Translator Service.
After Submit check the Approval inbox and send it to the Gatekeeper.

as discussed with Thomas I am creating a ticket.
We still have issues with images. Please find the report attached. At the end of the check, various images are only grey.
This issue has been pointed out by our CEO, the company owners and the head of our legal department.
Moreover, various walks have issues when the connection is interrupted. Some images get lost - users report that they take pictures on their tablet and take a picture of their tablet once they leave the store. I am surprised that the software is incapable of caching the images to upload once the WIFI connection or 5G connection resumes.

Our head of legal is not amused, as the images are not reliable enough as documentation for e.g. disciplinary actions against employees in case of failure in an audit.

This issue happened only for the total wine domain. For other clients recurring job was triggered simultaneously, and child projects were launched successfully for them. 

Also today we tried triggering a recurring job for total wine with one project (1256976), and the corresponding child was launched properly.

As mentioned earlier RESPONDER_DATA.TXN_DATA does not have SECTION_ID 2 data.

*Scenario:* User had already responded to the walk with 1 or more questions and application saves the progress in RESPONDER_SESSION_DATA collection so that it can navigate to the last section user saved before exit when user resumes the instance again.
However if for some reason if last section data is not present in the RESPONDER_SESSION_DATA Collection for the instance then it gives a null response and thereby application does not give valid response to start/resume the instance.

*Corrective Action:* 
Added a null check when User tries to fetch last section data so that application does not throw a null pointer exception in an event when last section data is not present in the database.

Application will return valid response so that instance can start/resume.

 

This code fix is given under TM-49930

The data correction is only for the given instance so the user can resume the walk and does not have to wait for code fix to be deployed on the environment.

Added a null check when User tries to fetch last section data so that application does not throw a null pointer exception in an event when last section data is not present in the database.</p>

<p>Application will return valid response so that instance can start/resume.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This code fix is given under <a href=""https://jira.zebra.com/browse/TM-49930"" title=""MYWORK 24.10 [UK] - EPW 6475 survey failing to launch"" class=""issue-link"" data-issue-key=""TM-49930""><del>TM-49930</del></a></p>

<p>The data correction is only for the given instance so the user can resume the walk and does not have to wait for code fix to be deployed on the environment.</p>

Bug,TM-51361,Send Email on new message added,Done,Rohit Sonar,2025-Feb-17 11:11 PM,"I don;t know if this is related to the earlier reported bugs with project messaging, but this functionality isnt working on Production. No email's are sent, for example when gatekeeper or creator unit is selected",,Closed by Salesforce,,,,,,Closed by Salesforce,Others,,,,,,,9,"Hi [~HD1845] 

 The main problem of system defined recipient Project Owner was fixed via scripts.

  For custom recipients here is the how email functionality works.
 *   If we are sending messages to units using custom recipients and those units are not actual project execution units, then we need to enable  "" Display Recipient Unit/Profile/Department instead of Description "" property in message type setup.
 * Once this property is enabled, in Send to dropdown you will see units in dropdown and when we select that unit emails will be sent.
 * If we have custom recipients and let's say if it belong to org level which is equal to project execution level, then above property won't impact much, we can turn on or off emails will work fine.

So as per issue, it looks there was custom recipient whose org level was not equal to project execution org level, so in that case we have to enable the property "" Display Recipient Unit/Profile/Department instead of Description "" in message type setup.

Also since the recipient mentioned in this issue ""Project Owner"" was a duplicate of System defined "" Project Owner"" recipient, and we have fixed system defined project owner recipient, so emails will work fine for client and emails will go to appropriate project owner.

For custom recipients follow above guidelines.

Bug,TM-51327,GER - TM - Audit -- Status -  Incorrect,Done,Raaga Vardhini,2025-Feb-15 1:03 AM,"Dear Support Team,

time and again we receive requests from users who are members of the “DE_TBL” user profile (Area) and who repeatedly receive the error message “error while processing” when trying to approve a task for certain sites. They report that this problem occurs again at same sites. 
We cannot recognize whether this is a user error and would therefore like to ask you to check why this happens.
As a result, the status is not displayed correctly in the TM. (please find the attached screenshots).

Bug,TM-51295,Pinboard data not matching Reports,Done,Mani Soundarajan,2025-Feb-14 4:24 AM,"We pulled the below data from Keith Schaeffer (user name SchaeffeK) and are unable to make the reports and the pinboard data match. We are wondering what goes into the Pinboard data-- we did look in the knowledgebase for Pinboard and On time completion to understand the data but it still does not match. There is one data point we could match-- that is listed below.

There was a concern raised that the Total Projects, Total Completion, and On-Time Completion shown on the first dashboard do not align with the data shown on the next dashboard. To start with, the total numbers do not match no matter how we filter the data. In the Pinboard, there are 2672 Projects but in the Current Projects it is 2218 and in the Field View Execution report it is 1955.
I dug in and tried to replicate the data shown in this completion rate dashboard but could not replicate all of it - 

Field View Execution shows Keith's area at 98.36% Completed not 78.07%. His total projects shows as 1955 instead of 2672 as well. 

I am able to replicate the On-Time Completion with the Project Completion Trend Report

 * The creator user “LVMX00108507” does not have the profile/department (ADMIN/R389) of the defined approver.
 * The most likely explanation for the project being launched directly is that the creator user had the profile/department of a defined approver at the time of launch, which was subsequently removed.

Hi [~PA1587] 
 * Regarding the provided screenshot 20990399_02102025_08.PNG, it is observed that the user “Lara Winzen” has switched to the DIVISION unit.
 * This user also has the profile/department (ADMIN/R389) of a defined approver in the userUnits. Therefore, when this user attempts to copy the reported project, the Launch button is displayed. This behaviour is functioning as expected.

	<li>Based on our analysis of the backend data, we have not identified any scenarios where the project could be launched without bypassing the approval process.</li>

Continuation of case #20846800

As part of the resolution for the issue where inhouse URL was not redirecting for the MGP application, Zebra team has done configuration changes and its redirecting to external browser to load the inhouse URL.
Due to some policy constraint , we can not opt this option to load the URL's in external Browser. Request you to help us to resolve this issue other than opening it into the external Browser.

If possible, Request you to set up a call with Engineering team to discuss on this further.

Testing

Make a plan as a (WR) Activity Planner
Check the look ahead calendar and plan is present
Switch to an applicable store as a profile that should see the plan - nothing visible.
Swtich to the store with a profile and dept NA to that store and plans can be seen.
Log in to the system as a Profile set up as unit user - nothing visible.

Replicate these steps using our new JL set up and all works.

Bug,TM-50277,Walk Due Dates,Done,Unassigned,2025-Jan-10 5:26 PM,"Hey Mark,

We had our new Walks launch today for 2025. I'm checking the Quarterly and Semi-Annual items. We use the Time restriction to set the due date for these. All walks on normally due on the 6th of the iteration. So for Quarterly, we set the time restriction so the Due Date should show as 4/6/2025 (in their Time Zone), and the Semi-Annual 7/6/2025 (in their Time Zone). When I pull the Reporting (Walk Schedule Report), I see many that are listed as due 4/7/25 or 7/7/25. How does the time zone play into this?

I also looked at the Branch Listings Review last quarter for the same branch compared to his quarter. Last quarter, the Walk shows it was due at 10:59PM on 10/6/24, and this quarter is shows due at 12:59AM on 4/7/25. 

It should be however many days from the date it launches, in their time zone? How would we get all of the dates to be the same in the future, across time zones, using the time restrictive option?",,Work Complete,,"The one hour difference is resolved in TM-48395 (DST related bug).

The APK file containing v24.10 was successfully launched and tested in our CAVE environment.

	Switch down to store 4126 and choose to be a Store Colleague
	Select the three horizontal bars to the top left
	Select My Work
	Open and complete any of the Walks that are on the landing page (date code)

This is not an issue. SWA reporting screen will display the Project/Task information created as part of Walk/Audit. Subsequent edit from Project Creator screen is not linked with Walk/Edit, hence Walk report will not display the information.

Bug,TM-49492,Unable to View Checklist for Complete Daily Checklist,Done,Rohit Sonar,2024-Dec-10 5:59 PM,"Hi Team,

A few stores are unable to view the checklist after marking the option Complete, and stores are having trouble seeing other options (In Progress/Complete) in My Work for the Complete Daily Checklist report. The few stores and the specific problem they are having with the checklist are listed below.

207 - Morning and Evening Checklists - When marked complete the dialogue boxes for the checklist does not populate.

602 - Reflexis closing checklist on 12/07/2024 did not provide the checklist when it was marked complete.

803 - Both open and closing check list instead of opening to the check list when picking complete in the drop down it simply closed the list.

1801 - The store is having an issue with the opening list.

1802 - The opening checklist did not populate in Reflexis after hitting the proper complete drop down. Instead, the task went straight to completed without the opening manager being able to complete it.

Would you kindly fix this report's functionality for every store, both listed and unlisted? Attaching a screenshot of store 602 (Good Case and Issue). Thanks!",,Closed by Salesforce,,,,,,Closed by Salesforce,Others,,,,,,,2,"Hi [~NS2980]

Bug,TM-49040,Formatting Issue for Images in Projects is not Consistent,Done,Sakshi Ade [X],2024-Nov-22 2:16 AM,"Hello,

Picture formatting within Projects is no longer consistent.

For instance, the first attachment is the project.  You can see that there is a small box icon and then an image of a chart that looks nice in the notes section during creation.

To the store manager, in their store view (task list or calendar) the box is squished, but the table image looks correct.

If the store manager (or creator) were to look in the summary view, the box and the table images look correct.

However, on the PDF export, BOTH images are squished and unreadable.",,Work Complete,,This Css changes applied only for that component,,,,Legacy,,"Notes resized image was being incorrectly displayed on pdf.

Bug,TM-49039,Walk completion not showing on Walk Summary or Performance Analysis,Done,Priyanka Anumula,2024-Nov-22 2:16 AM,"Hey there - odd one: There's a walk completion that doesn't appear to be showing on either the Walk Summary report, or the Performance Analysis report. It has been completed as it's showing on the field view projects. 

Is something blocking this, do we need different permissions, or is there something wrong with the data pulling through? 

Please see attached, but let me know if you need more information - thanks!

{$set: {""STATUS"" : ""A""}});  {code}
To get the instances that have old status I and new status A in MODEL_STATE_HISTORY.
{code:java}
db.getCollection(""MODEL_STATE_HISTORY"").aggregate({$match: {
      DOMAIN_ID: 121960099,
      MODEL_ID: ""FORM_1317"",
      OLD_STATUS: ""I"",
      NEW_STATUS: ""A"",
    },
  },
  {
    $group:
      /**
       * _id: The id of the group.
       * fieldN: The first field name.
       */
      {
        _id: ""FORM_TRACE_IDs"",
        fieldN: {
          $addToSet: ""$FORM_TRACE_ID"",
        }
      }}); {code}
Then, out of the all instances, to check instances that still have status I in FORM_MODEL.
{code:java}
db.getCollection(""FORM_MODEL"").find({
      DOMAIN_ID: 121960099,
      MODEL_ID: ""FORM_1317"",
      STATUS: ""I"",
      FORM_TRACE_ID: {$in: []}
    }).forEach(function(a){
        print(a.FORM_TRACE_ID);
});{code}

Bug,TM-48784,Incorrect language via the API for splitted projects,Done,Mayuresh Shinde,2024-Nov-12 6:31 PM,"We tested the splitted projects in the pre-production environment.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a splitted project in the master language German
1. Selection of several countries (e.g. DE + AT)
Recording the translations
3. Selection of markets in DE and AT
4. Publish the splitted project
5. Release by gatekeeper and quality gate
Actual situation: The AT-specific translations/adaptations, e.g. of the titles and descriptions of the projects and tasks, do not arrive in AT, but the projects and tasks appear in the AT market in the German master language (see example in appendix).
Target situation: The projects and tasks of the austrian translations should arrive in AT and not in the German master language",,Work Complete,,"MYWORK External APIs

What is worth noting that when you create a task and upload a PDF here this issue doesn't exist. The current issue within DOCs makes showing the modal and using the modal very poor and not user friendly.

To view the issue:

	Login SM100/SM100

Bug,TM-48261,How do we prevent closed stores from receiving program projects?,Done,Kapil Ranade,2024-Oct-24 9:55 PM,"When a store is closed for an extended period of time, we need to stop projects from generating.

To stop repeating projects we apply a blackout day and this works as expected.

However please can you advise how we can prevent program projects from generating?

Currently, we apply the following attribute ""Exclude demo store""
Should the following property in the project type setup ""Allow demo stores in the rollout?"" be switched on or off?

As we have different project types that have this switched on and off, yet all still seem to allow the program project to be launched to stores with the exclude store attribute. 

Example, store 7400 has the exclude demo store attribute. Please see attached screenshot, which shows they still received the the following project types:

Can we please have the JL001 division added to pre prod and can we also understand what steps have been missed by us, or what steps need to occur so this does not take place in Production, which we need to make in the next 4 weeks. To support Plans being added ahead of 2025.

Since taking deployment of v45.1.14.2 to PP we have been noticing unstable behaviour.

We will occasionally be logged out when navigating between menus, receiving an ""error while processing"" message in the top left hand corner. We do not have multiple windows open at the same time.

Additionally, we are experiencing an error message of ""No results to display"" when trying to Switch To units. Screenshot attached.

Closing the Switch To menu and attempting to switch again will return the same result. Once you press the 'Clear' option, results are returned.

Unfortunately this is intermittent and I have not been able to determine replication steps, it is occurring through ordinary navigation. 

Can we please advise?

As you know - we don't use the desktop version in our hotels so it's not mega urgent. However, I know that our Central Ops teams will notice this pretty quickly and so it needs to be fixed.

- For Pre-Plan Projects, when the final approver is user-based, and the current user is the final approver, the ""businessAppr"" parameter can be null during force close actions. This happens because the user dropdown is hidden in the force close pop-up for the final approver, so the ""businessAppr"" isn't sent from the UI side.

@Thondapu, Jagadesh,
 
We have requested OBI via customer team in June 2025 and they came back that they no plans to upgrade the APIGEE to v3 in near future, then how long we need to support old APIGEE versions if customer is not willing to move further.
 
Just FYI: All the new development of APIGEE will be planned for v4.
 
We need to work with customers with the action plan via PDM, customer service team to socialize this plan of action.
 
@Kalyanapu, Prasad: Even I am also aligned with Option 1 otherwise customer will not proceed further.
 
Thanks,
Prashant G

Subject: APIGEE v3 vs v2
Hello Jag:
I wanted to start the conversation regarding API fixes and versions.
Just as a point of reference, I am citing here a recently resolved ticket - TM-47785. Invalid root.id with underscores from Q-Walk.
The team is fixing the latest bugs in v3 and/or v4. But it looks like customers are still using v2. CFQ team is validating in v2 as well as v3, which does not make sense because the fix is not being done in v2.
 
We have to decide from the following options.
Option 1) We  advise customers to move to v3 and announce withdrawal of support for v2 OR 
Option 2) We continue to fix the issues in v2.
 
My recommendation is that we should go with option 1. We should communicate to customers that we no longer support v2 and that they should move to v3
 
Thanks and regards

Bug,TM-47754,2024 ADSF Remediation: Stored XSS Possible Via &lt;embed&gt; HTML Tag (Stored XSS),Done,Unassigned,2024-Sep-14 12:54 AM,"P2 VULNERABILITY (DUE 10/27/2024): FIX MUST BE INCLUDED IN OCTOBER 25TH MAINTENANCE

Vulnerability Citation 1 (1002002): Stored XSS Possible Via  HTML Tag

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) allows an attacker to submit specially crafted data to the application which is returned unaltered in the resulting
web page. The injected data can include HTML code which alters the appearance and functionality of the page, and/or JavaScript which
executes in the victim's browser. An attacker could use this to steal data from the victim such as session tokens and sensitive personal
data.

Observed URLs include, but are not necessarily limited to:

https://bankofamericapp.reflexisinc.com/RWS4/rosom/orgstructure/distributionlist/DistListMaintainence.jsp
https://bankofamericapp.reflexisinc.com/RWS4/rosom/orgstructure/common/cfg_attr_addedit.jsp

Vulnerability Citation Evidence:

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From the sidebar, navigate to Organization -> Distribution List
2. Click on an entry on the ""List Name"" column.
3. Insert  tag into the Description field. Example:
http://attackersite.example.com/xss.html>
4. Save.

See attached PDF for evidence

Recommendation:

Apply input filtering and output encoding to user supplied data before returning it to the user's browser. 
Apply business logic filters to user input (including cookies, POSTs, GETs, and headers), allowing only characters necessary for the requested input. Apply HTML or URL encoding to any returned values to neutralize any remaining and potentially dangerous characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML or script by the browser (""'`()=[];?*$%^&|/{} ) .

Looking for additional information on the Force Close option for Projects. KC doesn't lay out what happens if you do this. 

What if we hit the due date and Units have not completed, and we don't want to give them the option to complete late? Can you proactively set that up? Is that what the ""Auto Complete"" does during project creation? Is it basically the same thing?

Ones that are not done - if used Auto Complete - will continue to show Overdue? And the store won't see them as to-do's?",,Duplicate,,Duplicate of TM-47788.

Since the 24.8 release on Wednesday last week (18/9) we have established that we are unable to view other users messages on existing forms 

Here is an example :

Corp user Jason Stone - 80313663 is unable to see the message from Corp user Kate Hattersley - 77292073 on form 'Unable to Generate wc 27/10' 
Kate is also unable to see Jasons message 
In addition no shop profiles are able to see either Jason or Kates responses despite having a blue dot to indicate that there is a new unread message on the form. 
See SS attached of Jasons message viewed from his account, see 2nd SS attached of Kates message (viewed from her account) on the form which was added after Jasons but does not display Jasons message. 
Also see screen recording attached to demonstrate what shop users are presented with.

Impact Desc : Template Override Scenario where Template Creator overrides a Walk Template when Store User is actively working on the walk instance and responses are saved by auto save call.

Please find root cause for replication steps below.",,,,Legacy,,"Root Cause :

In Template Override Scenario when Old Template is copied and Override option is selected, System would update Old MODEL_ID to new MODEL_ID for all Inactive Instances along with deleting Question Response related data.
But when during this process, if a Store User is already in the Walk Instance screen (conducting the old instance) and auto save call is triggered then it would save the Question Responses with Old Model Id present in the User Session hence creating data issues (Some responses are saved with Old MODEL_ID).

However on Click of Next button, User is thrown an error message and navigates out of the Walk Instance screen as per functionality.

When User resumes the same instance again, Responses are saved with new MODEL_ID as per the functionality.

Here Issue is , during auto save call, System allows to save Question Responses with old MODEL_ID.",,,,"Corrective Action :

We would compare the QUESTION_DATA creation time of new MODEL_ID with Walk Instance creation time and if Questions are edited then a Error Message is displayed (""Walk is being edited and all the responses will get discarded."") not allowing User to save Question Response during auto save call.
This functionality is already present for other button types like Next, Review etc.
In this issue we have fixed for auto save button type (""Save and Continue"").",Code Error,20,"I checked this issue on the latest APPRL (v25.1.0.3) environment and found that the functionality is now working fine.

The user is now kicked out of the walk during the auto save call due to the walk being edited at the creator's end. This doesn't allow the system to save the data against the wrong model ID, and saves the integrity of the walk reports.

Bug,TM-46659,Reflexis - Coop Switzerland - Shared Project Notification Missing since 24.08. Release | 19757890,Done,Madhura Palsodkar [X],2024-Aug-29 8:22 PM,"With the new Release 24.8. on Production the Shared Project Notification to regional creators (Verfasser VRE in Retail Banner) is missing when projects are created with Project Type BE1. Only Project Type BE1 is touched by the issue.
Issue occurs on PreProd as well but unfortunately this has not been detected during UAT at Coop.

Steps to reproduce:
Login as TESTRTMDIR3 and create a new project using Project Type BE1. It is enough to select German only language and select BE, NWZZ, OT for distribution. Forward project to next approver which ist Verfasser_2.
Login as TESTRTMGKBE and switch to Hauptsitz. Approve and forward project and then again approve and forward the project (twice needed because of optional translation services step).
Project splits into regions and sits now at the regional gatekeepers desk.
In parallel a Shares Project Notification should have arrived at regional creators desk which is not the case.
If you log in as TESTRTMVREOT or TESTRTMVRENZ in Project Inbox you can see that ""Shared Project"" entries are only to be seen before the release 24.8. on August 27",,Work Complete,,This impacts only Shared Project Notification functionality being used by COOP Switzerland. Also it can affect any other custom flows being used other clients.,,,,Regression,,"There is custom flow being used by client to send extra notification to users when project is being split. This flows were configured in existing approval workflow. In the approval workflow message, there is one ""To Org Level"" field. This value was not being used in out existing base workflows, so it didn't affect core approval functionality. But this value was used in custom configuration of share project which got impacted.",,,,Code fix was done to send appropriate value for this To Org Level field. This field was not set properly only in case of split optional approval workflow functionality.,Code Error,7,"Issue is not reproducible on TASK-24.9.1.6

Bug,TM-46338,Bashas - PreProd - No Units Populating in Switch To,Done,Unassigned,2024-Aug-20 10:55 PM,"Hello Team,
We have a critical issue where we can no longer switch into specific units via the Switch To function. When we navigate to switch into a location at the CORP level, no units are populating on the page. I have verified that we have the units configured in both the ORG - Units page and RWS - Units page. This functionality was working last night. We have our Train the Trainer session tomorrow and need to have the Switch To function working by the start of that meeting otherwise, we run the risk of delaying the project from entering the UAT phase. 
Steps to Replicate:
1) Login to the Bashas environment using a SYSADMIN login
2) Select the top right corner of the page on the user name
3) Select ""Switch To"" from the dropdown
4) Notice no units are ""Switchable"" and the page says ""No Results to display""",,Work Complete,,,,,,Not a Bug,,,,,,,Invalid Issue,2,"Hi Team,

Patrick",,Closed by Salesforce,,,,,,Legacy,Others,Currently the UTC date is sent to mywork & mywork is expecting the date as per unit/user timezone.,,,,Sending the date after converting to unit/user timezone. We were having the date only so while converting the date to unit/user timezone we are using the timestamp when the action is performed.,Code Error,6,"Hi [~PK3866], 

The initial issue was because AAR is not considering the user timezone  and sending the date in UTC. But MYWORK is treating those date, as those are as per User timezone and in some edge case scenario we show data discrepancy in 2 systems.

*This issue is fixed and part of 25.1. So now before sending date to MYWORK, AAR convert the dates in User timezone.*

But QA re-opened this as the date ranges is not matching with data shown as part of filter. Below is scenario.

*Scenario:*
 * AAR execute the query to find the minimum and maximum start date of project.
 * It doesn't consider any priority or any other filter at that time.
 * Data display in UI  based on priority.
 * Suppose User clicking the medium priority, it redirect to the MYWORK and we send the same dates(fetched in steps 1) and medium filter.
 * Filters sent, is applied to MYWORK screen.
 * The projects shown after applying filter doesn't have the same date range applied in filter.

The reason for that as we are not considering any filter while fetching dates from our system. It will impact the overall execution if we need to provide dates based on filters selection. *The actual issue related to count mismatch is fixed.*

Bug,TM-46278,myWalk: Users able to Complete Walk after Expiration Time,Done,Deepak Shinde [X],2024-Aug-16 10:48 PM,"I was looking at the myWalk Schedule Report and noticed there were several walk instances in the month of August with a status of ""Completed Late"" which users should not be able to do.

The AM Daily Compliance Checklist is set to end every day at 12:00 PM local time and expire 0 hours after which means it should never fall into an Overdue status. There are 22 instances where the walk was able to be completed after the 12:00 PM expiration time. I've provided screenshots from store CVS00023 showing the walk being in red (indicative that it was past due),  but marked complete with a claim time of 12:30 PM and a completion time of 12:32 PM, both times after it's expiration.

Can you please look into how this is occurring?

I've attached 4 screenshots, 2 are the CVS00023 example, one of the myWalk Schedule Report showing there are 22 instances of a store able to complete a walk after it's expiration time with the filters used for the report, and the final one showing more stores with a ""Completed Late"" status from the report.",,Work Complete,,"Walk Expiry Conduit.

Bug,TM-45479,RTM/PLN - Template inbox covering both modules for RTM Creator,Done,Shirish Gaikwad,2024-Aug-02 6:21 PM,"Hi Team,
In testing 24.7 (although this is also in Prod as we are only just starting to use templates in PLN) we have noticed that the template inbox under RTM is covering RTM & PLN. 
When opening the template inbox as a RTM creator I see plans and projects, (78 at the top of the inbox)
If I open the filter there is no option for plans, just projects.
If I open a plan template and navigate back the inbox reduces to 17 - only plans. If I do the same from projects there is no change. 

If i log on as a PLN creator I have template in look ahead (PLN) too, this inbox has the 18, BUT the RTM inbox still has both modules.

Expectation is that the template inbox relates to the module it is has been navigated too from.

Video attached showing the behaviour.

Thanks

This is the scenario as an example where we saw it happen (and Leire, you have the screen record of this happening when Shannon shared her screen at our last bi-weekly status call): *Went in to force close a project for a single store, Store 6308. See screenshot for list of projects we went in to force close; when i go to those projects in the Inbox, it let me force close the project for one store but not any of the others. The project now shows as force closed (see second screenshot attached), but it is only really force closed for one store. And when you go in to the project, you can see that it is still listed as overdue for 148 stores. And I am not iven any actions to perform aside from ""Reset"" - we don't normally use reset so we didn't select that to try to do anything with that. I waited a few daus from when that happened to see if it was a fluke, but it did the same thing again for another project on that list in the first screenshot.

While looking at weekly completion percentages, I noticed that all stores were missing at minimum one project for the week.  I used the audit report and found the yearly Repeating project ""Hurricane Preparedness - June 1st"" ran overdue for all.  I then logged into a store and went back to June 3rd and looked for completed projects and it seems the project never showed up at the stores.  The project is set to auto complete after 45 days, which would have made it fall in this weeks reporting.  I have attached the audit report showing the overdue project at each store.

Bug,TM-45317,Projects with feedback surveys won't complete,Done,Ratneshwar Kumar Dwivedi [X],2024-Jul-27 1:44 AM,"Good afternoon,
A store brought an issue to our attention.  We have a project come out on Fridays called ""Out of Stock - Store Survey and Reporting"".  The manager stated that the system wouldn't let her complete the project after inputting her answers.  I remoted in and watch her do it and sure enough, when she clicked on the submit button nothing happened.  I then noticed that the Project Visible dates at the top left of the screen were showing ""06/6/2024 to 06/13/2024"".  I had her refresh her browser, once refreshed the dates changed to ""06/07/2024 to 06/14/2024"".  She tried it again and was able to complete the project just fine after entering the same numbers.  I think this would happen for any project that has feedback questions.  For some reason this calendar isn't changing at midnight when the system is logged in overnight.  I believe this may also be causing the issue with projects not arriving correctly (case 18340392).  Can't this date automatically change at midnight?

Today while doing an inspection with one of our field users, I noticed there is an issue when there is a photo attached to a walk question.  When you are answering the questions in the section that includes an attached photo, the screen moves down and then back up.  This happens each time you answer a question in that section.  Once you move onto a new section that doesn't have any attached photos, the issue doesn't happen.  If you would like to test, the walk named ""New Store Checklist - v0.0.3"" is the one I noticed it on.  This is only happening on Mobile.

I've attached the project summary for your reference as well as some screenshots that show the following:

	I completed a single store force close for store 2251 on 7/19. Now when I go back to the project to make another edit it shows as over all force closed and I cannot edit or make any changes.
	The other stores are still live. I went a checked a store who's listed as Not Started (store 0511) and they still have the project in their queue.
Why is this happening like this? Is it a glitch? How can it be updated so I can continue to monitor and update the project for the remaining 267 stores as needed?

Bug,TM-45158,Walk Points Not Displaying on Walk PDF,Done,Deepak Shinde [X],2024-Jul-19 12:33 PM,"Hello, 

I have attached a walk PDF (found in the Show Store Walk report section) . Each question is given a point value, but the points scored are not being shown on the PDF. The only score being shown is the overall score at the top. 

In addition, there are NO scores or points shown on the walk post action PDF. Photo attached here also. 

This is an urgent case that requires a solution as quickly as possible. We need to be able to see points scored per question and total walk score on both of these PDFs. Let me know if it's something that needs to be done on my end.
